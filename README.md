### What is this?
This is an automated solution for a biweekly billing process that I do for my client: IA1. Every fortnight, I have to prepare and send an invoice to the client for the services I provide to them.

### Why UiPath?
This bot was built using UiPath particularly to practice my UiPath skills.

### Why automate the process?
* Reduced manual effort
* Quicker realization of income by way of earliest dispatch of invoice to client 

### High-level steps
 1. Determine project hours, rate, and details
 2. Determine project hours breakdown
 3. Create invoice in QuickBooks
 4. Prepare and send invoice email to client

### Where can I find more details on the process?
Please refer to the PDD for the business process located in the Documentation folder. It contains detailed steps performed as part of the billing process. Also, refer to the input files as well as the output files to better understand how the bot works.
